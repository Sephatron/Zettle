Before David takes on the armies of Saul and claims the throne of Israel, the chronicler lists Israel’s army’s composition.

Among this list are all kinds of crucial components:

- Shield and spear bearers [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/13 - 1 Chronicles/1 Chron-12#v23]]
- Warriors [[Scripture (WEB)/13 - 1 Chronicles/1 Chron-12#v24]]
- Bravery [[Scripture (WEB)/13 - 1 Chronicles/1 Chron-12#v26]]
- Experienced soldiers [[Scripture (WEB)/13 - 1 Chronicles/1 Chron-12#v33]]

Buried in this list is a requirement for Men who understand the times and understand what Israel (God’s people) should do [[Scripture (WEB)/13 - 1 Chronicles/1 Chron-12#v32]]

# It is important to understand the times and know what to do.

That’s why God included men of this inclination in David’s army.
