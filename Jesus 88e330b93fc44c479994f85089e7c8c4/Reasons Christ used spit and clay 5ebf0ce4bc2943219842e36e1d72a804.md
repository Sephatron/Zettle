# Why does Jesus spit on mud and dab on the blind man?

[[Matthew Henry]] gives 2 great reasons:

> [!Quote] 1. To magnify his power in making a blind man to see by that method which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind.
> 

Clay dabbed on an eye in a practical sense is more likely to close up an eye than open it.

How mighty is [[Jesus]] that, when he uses clay on an eye, he can achieve sight for the blind man!

> [!Quote] 2. To give an intimation that it was his mighty hand, the very same that at first made.man out of the clay for by him God made the worlds, both the great world, and the man the little world.
> 

Isn’t it amazing that Jesus uses the same material to give this man sight as he used at first to give the first man [[Adam]] life!

> Now Christ did this, (1) To magnify his power in making a blind man to see by that method which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind. Daubing clay on the eyes would close them up, but never open them. Note, The power of God often works by contraries and he makes men feel their own blindness before he gives them sight (2) To give an intimation that it was his mighty hand, the very same that at first made man out of the clay for by him God made the worlds, both the great world, and man the little world. Man was formed out of the clay, and moulded like the clay, and here Christ used the same materials to give sight to the body that at first he used to give being to it. - **[[Matthew Henry]]**
