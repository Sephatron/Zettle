The Messiah literally means: “anointed one (מָשִׁיחַ Maschiach)”.

It is the Hebrew equivalent to the Greek word, [[Christ]].

Throughout the [[old covenant]] [[God]] promises to send His anointed one [[Scripture (WEB)/27 - Daniel/Dan-09#25]] to save His people from the [[sin]] that separates them from himself.
