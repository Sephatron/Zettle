### 32

They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”

### 33

He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.

### 34

“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,”he said to them. “Stay here and keep watch.”

### 35

Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.

### 36

“Abba,  Father,”he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
