The 10 commandments (given in [[Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-20]]), are a series of things God’s people must do in order to be in right standing with Him.

The purpose of these commandments, sometimes called [[the law]] is to demonstrate the sinful heart-nature of humans [[Romans 7.7-11]].

# 1: You shall have no other Gods before me

The commandments are rooted in the most important commandment: worship only [[God]] [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-05#v7]].

# 2: You shall not make for yourself an idol

Given that God is the only one to be worshipped, it is an insult to God for the [[worship]] due to Him alone to be directed at an idol.

[[Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-20#v4]]

# 3: Don’t take God’s name in vain

Misuse of God’s name is to diminish the nature of God.

# 4: Keep the Sabbath holy

Set apart time. The sabbath was made for man though! - see [[The Habit of Rest]].
