The Law was given to Moses atop Mt. Sinai.

It was part of [[God]]’s covenant with Moses (and Israel) by Which God promised to make Israel a “kingdom of Priests and a Holy nation”. [[Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-19#v5]][[Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-19#v6]]

The Law were a list of commandments God instituted to demonstrate the sinner’s heart of rebellion [[Romans 7.7-11]].

The [[10 commandments]] is sometimes how the law is referred to.
