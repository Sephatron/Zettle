# The New Covenant

As per the [[Gospel]] message, we now live under a new covenant with God:[[Jeremiah 31 - 31-40]] & [[Luke-22#v20]].

[[God]] is our God and WE are His people. Our[[sin]] is forgiven as [[Jesus]] paid the full price for it on the cross. Dealing with our sin and our sin nature (see: [[Adam]] and [[federal head]]), Jesus has imputed His righteousness to us. God sees us as He sees Jesus!
