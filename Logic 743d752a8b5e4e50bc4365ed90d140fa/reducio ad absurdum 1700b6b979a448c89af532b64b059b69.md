# Reduction to Absurdity!

This is a **logical form of argument** that shows the opposing argument reduces to absurdity.

Example:

> An atheists says:
> 

> [!Quote]
> 
> 
> “I can’t believe in a God who would let babies die of cancer”
> 

> This is a moral argument against God
> 

> Morals only exist in a universe with a clearly defined: right & wrong
> 

> The atheist, by definition, denies this reality and is therefore borrowing from the Christian worldview to argue against the Christian worldview
> 

> A reductio ad absurdum would be to point out that in a universe where matter is merely in motion; a bag of space dust (baby) dying of cancer is meaningless and is therefore not a valid complaint.
> 

> In fact, no complaint is valid as it’s all entirely relative.
