# Jesus the Son of God

Is a short (3 chapter) book/essay on the specific subject of what it means that [[Jesus]] is described as the [[Son]] of [[God]].

# Literature notes.

Broadly speaking, theologians tend to use three categories when talking about the Sonship of Jesus.

## 1. They’ll talk about the son in terms of trinitarian theology.

The Son is an eternal person in the Godhead (the [[Trinity]]. Most theologians refer to how the Son of God applies to the Godhead.

Not many theologians talk about how the Son of God applies to Jesus - ([[D.A. Carson]] argues this point in his essay/book [[Jesus the Son of God - A Christological Title Often Overlooked, Sometimes Misunderstood, and Currently Disputed]])

## 2. Specialist treatments of specific uses.

For example, Simon Janse’s: [[“You are my Son” - the reception history of Psalm 2 in early Judaism and the early church]]

## 3. Controversies

1. The debate over the extent to which the son isn’t subordinate to the [[father]]. Proponents of this type of literature have their roots in the [[egalitarian]] approach to theology.
2. Debates about how, “son of God” must be translated for readers in the Muslim world.

# But what does, “son of God” when applied to Jesus mean?

## Sons and sonship

**Most** of the times words meaning son OR sons are found in the bible, it is not referring to the Son of God.

Sometimes the son is named (E.G Obed in [[Obed passage]])

Issac - [[Scripture (WEB)/01 - Genesis/Gen-22 > v2]]

Sometimes the Son is identified with a patronymic (literally means: Father’s name): eg. Son of Jesse of Bethlehem [[Scripture (WEB)/09 - 1 Samuel/1 Sam-16 > v18]]

References to a group (E.G “sons of Zebedee” in the NT).

If not a patronymic then another identifier e.g: The son of Pharos’s daughter [[Scripture (WEB)/58 - Hebrews/Heb-11 > v24]]or, “carpenter’s son” [[Scripture (WEB)/40 - Matthew/Matt-13 > v55]].

Sometimes the son isn’t named but the context makes it clear that title is envisaged in the mind of the author e.g [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/12 - 2 Kings/2 Kings-04 > v28]]

This usage is very common:

[[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/12 - 2 Kings/2 Kings-16 > v3]] [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-01 > v57]]

Under this usage we find moments in the bible where the parent is known and she addresses a biological son (e.g [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-02 > v48]].

Sometimes the context shows the name isn’t for an individual but for a group or class (e.g: [[Scripture (WEB)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-08 > v5]].

It’s found in the NT too (e.g [Scripture (WEB)/40 - Matthew/Matt-10 > v37](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/40%20-%20Matthew/Matt-10#v37) or [Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-15 > v11](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/42%20-%20Luke/Luke-15#v11)).

Son is sometimes used not to address an immediate male descendent but a distant (often younger) male in a line of succession (e.g: [Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-16 > v25](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/42%20-%20Luke/Luke-16#v25)).

All of the above mentions **presuppose** a natural/biological relationship as opposed to metaphorical use.

**Sons of X: where X is anything but God**

In our modern day and age, sonship can be irrefutably established with sciences such as the study of DNA.

We also use the language today of adopted sons. The biological definition isn’t applicable but the legal and familial ideas are still crucial.

what we DON’T use in the modern vernacular are phrases like:

“sons of affliction”
“son of the morning”
“son of a bow”

etc.

What do these phrases have in common then? In our culture, it is way less common that Sons do what their fathers do. This wasn’t the case biblically. In fact, quite the opposite. If a father was a tent maker, the son likely would be too.

It’s why Jesus could both be known as, “the carpenter’s son” [Scripture (WEB)/40 - Matthew/Matt-13 > v55](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/40%20-%20Matthew/Matt-13#v55) and “the carpenter” [Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/41 - Mark/Mark-06 > v3](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/41%20-%20Mark/Mark-06#v3).

Your identity, trade and vocation are learnt from your father in ancient times, not from a nearby vocational school or college!

Your father determined your identity. This matters because the same happens transparently. In other words, the son does not give his identity to the father. Not biologically and not vocationally.

Your paternity was responsible for much more than just your genes. He established your place in the world and family.

There are a LOT of expressions using this deeper cultural meaning that don’t retain the, ‘sons of’ expression in modern translations (because we wouldn’t immediately understand it).

What follows is a non exhaustive list of examples where the, ‘sons of’ sentiment hasn’t been rendered in the translation.

Where it originally reads: “sons of X” the X is usually a concept or idea.

The exact nuance of the relationship is really variable.

Sometimes, the reason the exact rendering is left out is to avoid it being misleading. In the ESV that mistake still exists in Nehemiah 12:28:

> And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
> 

An untrained modern reader may mistake this to mean literal biological sons rather than the inherited identity sense the biblical language often implies.

**Sons of X expressions where X is God**

Excluding instances where “son of God” is clearly Christological of course.

The point of looking at these expressions is to highlight that the concept of sonship can apply to a diverse range of beings.

Son of God often refers to Israel collectively too. [Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-04 > 22](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/02%20-%20Exodus/Exod-04#22)[Scripture (WEB)/02 - Exodus/Exod-04 > v23](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/02%20-%20Exodus/Exod-04#v23).

[Scripture (WEB)/19 - Psalm/Ps-80 > v15](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/19%20-%20Psalm/Ps-80#v15) - same collective meaning as above![Scripture (WEB)/28 - Hosea/Hos-11 > v1](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/28%20-%20Hosea/Hos-11#v1)[Scripture (WEB)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-02 > v18](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/05%20-%20Deuteronomy/Deut-02#v18)[Scripture (WEB)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-31 > v9](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/24%20-%20Jeremiah/Jer-31#v9)

The expression sons of God can also refer to the plural of God’s covenant (old and new) people:

[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-14 > v1](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/05%20-%20Deuteronomy/Deut-14#v1)[Scripture (WEB)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-43 > v6](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/23%20-%20Isaiah/Isa-43#v6)[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-45 > v11](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/23%20-%20Isaiah/Isa-45#v11)[Scripture (WEB)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-03 > v19](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/24%20-%20Jeremiah/Jer-03#v19)[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/48 - Galatians/Gal-03 > v26](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/48%20-%20Galatians/Gal-03#v26)[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/62 - 1 John/1 John-03 > v1](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/62%20-%201%20John/1%20John-03#v1)

God is referred to under the old covenant as the Heavenly Father.

Under the New covenant, believers are taught to refer to God as, “our father”

Sonship can also refer to us as Christians **when** we are imitating Christ: [Scripture (WEB)/40 - Matthew/Matt-05 > v9](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/40%20-%20Matthew/Matt-05#v9)

These words presuppose that those who make peace are part of God’s peacemaking clan. This isn’t an instruction to be saved.

[Scripture (WEB)/19 - Psalm/Ps-82 > v6](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/19%20-%20Psalm/Ps-82#v6)[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-06 > v35](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/42%20-%20Luke/Luke-06#v35)[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-06 > v36](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/42%20-%20Luke/Luke-06#v36)[Scripture (WEB)/19 - Psalm/Ps-02 > v6](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/19%20-%20Psalm/Ps-02#v6)[Scripture (WEB)/19 - Psalm/Ps-89](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/19%20-%20Psalm/Ps-89) -19-29[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-21 > v10](app://obsidian.md/Scripture%20(WEB)/Scripture%20(WEB)/26%20-%20Ezekiel/Ezek-21#v10)

Sonship language can also be applied to believers eschatologically:

## Jesus the son of God
