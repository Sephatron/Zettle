I see a father as one who has [paternal](../paternal%206e3062774fd74af9bdfed220e6c22089.md) responsibility for another.

Sometimes this is biological (my dad), sometimes it’s spiritual (people I look up to and respect.

It’s also an expression of the third person of [God](../God%204b8a0a68f5854beeb2de6ddd5089f1d3.md).

# God the Father

God has eternally existed as one being in [Trinity](Trinity%207dfe8984a827473999f855401b0ac643.md)  with three co-equal people:[Father](Father%205d8c3d0e4bfe4e81886d6bb60d719719.md)  [Son](../Jesus%2088e330b93fc44c479994f85089e7c8c4/Son%207be0bc887e7b4b378a958e1f1716e78c.md) and [Holy Spirit ](../Holy%20Spirit%20d8d61874e48a424a941ddbd79406114e.md). 

God the Father is the person to whom we pray (Luke 11:2) 

God the Father sends God the son to die in our place and pay the price for [sin](../Theological%20topics%20of%20interest%2013c6280304ce4c368b9ee6f8e5b0fcc2/sin%20dbaced60ee2c4881a16608b3cf9ef17b.md) .

God the Father creates with Holy Spirit .
