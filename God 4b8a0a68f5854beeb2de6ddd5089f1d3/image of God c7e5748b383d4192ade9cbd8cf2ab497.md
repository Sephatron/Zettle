# Image of God/ imago DEI

Humans (both male & female) were created to resemble God [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/01 - Genesis/Gen-01#v26]] [[Scripture (WEB)/Scripture (WEB)/01 - Genesis/Gen-01#v27]].

This Image of God is inherent to humans. It’s what gives us our beauty, dignity and worth. It’s why murder is a [[sin]] and it’s why we should love one another.
