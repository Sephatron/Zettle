# If God is the source of everything…

Then, by necessity he must be irreducibly complex.

In other words, God must be simple.

**This is not a derogatory statement**

Irreducible complexity simply means that God can’t be explained in terms of things external to Himself.

## Does the bible attribute God as the source of all things?

[[Scripture (WEB)/45 - Romans/Rom-11#v36]] suggests so.

> God is not an entity that depends upon or is founded upon realities more basic or fundamental or absolute than himself
