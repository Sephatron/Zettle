# Should we limit communion to keep it special?

[[Doug Wilson]] says no!

We want to think that rarity makes the meal ‘special.’ In a distorted way, it does, but it has many harmful effects. A husband would not make love to his wife on a quarterly basis to keep the experience ‘special.’ A man would not have dinner with his family once a month to keep the event wonderful. Neither should we pull away from communion with Christ and His people to ‘drive the price up.’ We should pray for the opportunity to begin weekly Communion in our churches.”
