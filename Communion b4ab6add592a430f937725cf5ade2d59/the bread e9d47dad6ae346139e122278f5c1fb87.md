# [[Jesus]] instituted [[communion]].

The [[sacrament]] where we partake of 2 elements:

- the Bread
- [[the cup]]

We do this to remember Jesus and to celebrate what he has done.

# The Bread represents Christâ€™s body

We partake of the bread to remember and celebrate the [[mercy]] of God in breaking the body of Christ in our place.

In his body broken on [[the cross]] Jesus took the [[wrath of God]] on himself.
