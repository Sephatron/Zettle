# The blood of [[Jesus]]

The cup is one of 2 elements we partake of in the [[sacrament]] of communion.

We take [[the bread]] to remember and celebrate God’s [[mercy]].

we take the cup to celebrate and remember God’s [[Grace]].

Jesus shed his blood on the cross. He did this in order to give us what we do not deserve, his [[Righteousness]]. We are covered by his blood and seen as righteous before God because of this gift.
