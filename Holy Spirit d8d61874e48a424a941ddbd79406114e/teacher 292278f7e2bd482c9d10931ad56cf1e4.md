# Teacher - a ministry of the Holy Spirit.

The [[Holy Spirit]] gifts the church with particular people who are able to provide specific functions to the body of Christ.

Of these gifted ministries, Teacher is one.

More specifically, the grammar of [[Scripture (WEB)/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-04#v11]] seems to imply the ministry is that of a Pastor and Teacher (some times described as Pastor/Teacher).

In other words, this ministry serves the same function as the role [[Pastor]].
