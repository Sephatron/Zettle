# Praying the Examen

The Examen is an ancient [[Jesuit]] tradition.

It’s a prayer of [[reflection]] designed to centre the believer at the end of the day.

The stages of the Examen are:

- **REPLAY**

This is the art of *slowly* replaying the details of the events of the day. Specifically, this is looking at all the day’s events and asking questions like: Where was God when that happened? Where was God in that encounter with another person? Where was God when that good/bad thing happened?

It’s like rummaging around in the drawer of the day and finding where God was in it.

- **REJOICE**

As I rummage through the drawer of my day, think about the treasures in there. Think about the little gems that put a smile on my face, made me feel good etc. Consciously rejoice in those divinely appointed moments of goodness.

Thank God for that.

- **REPENT**

Just as I rummaged for the gems of the day and turned that to rejoicing, so I should rummage for the stuff that needs throwing out.

The bad attitudes I experienced, the times I got angry, felt lustful, sinned in another way. Acknowledge them before God as part of this process and repent of them.

- **REBOOT**

Think about tomorrow, ask God to help me with the challenges I might face. Consciously think about the fact that, "His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning.
