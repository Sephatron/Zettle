# Chapter 11

### 45

Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.

### 46

But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

### 47

Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.

“What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many signs.

### 48

If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”

### 49

Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You know nothing at all!

### 50

You do not realise that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”

### 51

He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,

### 52

and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.

### 53

So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

### 54

Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.

### 55

When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.

### 56

They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, “What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the festival at all?”

### 57

But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.

# Chapter 12

### 1

Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

### 2

Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honour. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.

### 3

Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

### 4

But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,

### 5

“Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages”.

### 6

He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.

### 7

“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. 8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”

### 9

Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

### 10

So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,

### 11

for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.
