[[So that you may believe - John 6]] - Connected to this Sermon

### 3

he who watches over you will not slumber;

### 4

indeed, he who watches over Israel
will neither slumber nor sleep.

### 5

The Lord watches over you—
the Lord is your shade at your right hand;
##### 6

the sun will not harm you by day,
nor the moon by night.

### 7

The Lord will keep you from all harm—
he will watch over your life;

### 8

the Lord will watch over your coming and going
both now and forevermore.
