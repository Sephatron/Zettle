# Matthew 28: 16-20

### 6

Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

### 17

When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.

### 18

Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

### 19

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

###### 20

and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
