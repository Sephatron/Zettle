# John 5 - In the waters of Bethesda.

### 5

Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals.

### 2

Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.

### 3

Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralysed.

### 5

One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.

### 6

When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”

### 7

“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”

### 8

Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”

### 9

At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.

The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,

### 10

and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”

### 11

But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”

### 12

So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”

### 13

The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.

### 14

Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”

### 15

The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.

### The Authority of the Son

### 16

So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.

### 17

In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”

### 18

For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
