### 7

What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”  ###### 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. ###### 9  I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.  ###### 10  The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.  ###### 11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
