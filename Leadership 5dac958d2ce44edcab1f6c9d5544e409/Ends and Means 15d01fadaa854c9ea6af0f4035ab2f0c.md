Leadership involves discerning **ends** from **means**.

# Ends

Goals, destinations, purposes.

[[Eugene Peterson]] categorises it as

> The what of life, its ultimate meaning.
> 

# Means

Means are the methods by which you arrive at the ends.

In his book, [[the Jesus Way]], Peterson defines it as:

> The way to get to the goal, the language we use, the work we do, the character we develop, the families and friends we form, the “how” of life.
> 

# our ends as Christians

The ends for a Christian is God’s work in salvation.

Sometimes this is expressed as the [[kingdom of God]].

# our means as Christians

Simply put, Jesus.
