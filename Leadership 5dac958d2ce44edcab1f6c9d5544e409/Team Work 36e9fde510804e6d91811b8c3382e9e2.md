# A group of people 👥

Within the [[church]], this is always the case. The bible isn’t about isolated Christianity or isolated leadership.

[[Scripture (WEB)/46 - 1 Corinthians/1 Cor-12]] Work together as a body.

We are different and need each other.

Jesus sent out his disciples in pairs and Paul appointed leadership teams.

[[Scripture (WEB)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-15#v22]]

Not every group is a team though! Children in a classroom for example.

It needs more than that.

# Complementary skills 🤝

A team is effective precisely because of its complementary skills.

A team is different from a committee. There is an equality among the different skillets.

[[Eldership]] is not based on having a balanced team. They are chosen based on calling rather than, “we could really do with someone who is good at finance”

# With a shared approach 🚀

For a team to work, there needs to be an agreed way of doing things. For a [[church]], you would add to that a set of values you would want to permeate the team.

Having a defined style is core to what makes a team work. How are decisions made etc?

Drawing different people out in the conversation is vital.

Submitting to team decisions is important too.

Delegation is an important facet of a shared approach.

If a team is going to work it comes down to good delegation.

When a task is delegated, it doesn’t have to be done in the leader’s way but it does have to be done in a way that the leader is comfortable with.

Behind any leader there is a wake! This wake is the parameters by which the leader is comfortable with being done.

# With a shared goal 🎯

Teams should only exist for a particular reason. Why does this team exist?

# What makes a good team?

Teams need a good leader. linked to: [[Leadership]] Confidentiality accountability Being happy for the team to get the credit The ability to work well with others How well do you listen? How well do you submit?
