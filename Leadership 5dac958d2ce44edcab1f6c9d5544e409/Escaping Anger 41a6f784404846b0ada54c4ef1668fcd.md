As I already inherently know how to spot fear and anger - [[cull fear and anger from decision making]], what’s of next importance is knowing what to do when I’m in either state.

# Changing states

## Physical state

- If i’m sitting down I could **stand up**
- If i’m inside I could **go outside**
- If i’m sedentary, I could **move lots**

## Mental state

Turn off stimuli - get bored and get comfortable with being bored
