# Top goal

In life, on any given day there are conflicting **inbound** demands on your attention.

The TOP GOAL principle is carving out a **set-time** (2 hours) each day to work specifically on YOUR most important actions.

# Do it early

The earlier you do this in your day the better

# Donâ€™t respond to inbounds

Ignore your emails, texts, messages or calls.
