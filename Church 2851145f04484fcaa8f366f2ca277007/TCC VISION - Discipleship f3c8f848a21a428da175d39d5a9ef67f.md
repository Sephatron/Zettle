# TCC Vision:

> [!Quote] We seek to produce disciples who are becoming more like [[Jesus]]
> 

Discipleship doesn’t happen in a classroom but in daily life.

The [[disciples]] of Jesus left their nets and followed him.

It’s about **leaving the old life behind** and **beginning a new one**

- [[Scripture (WEB)/42 - Luke/Luke-09#v23]]

# What does leaving our old life behind look like?

It isn’t just about stopping sinning but also about leaving behind striving, shame, guilt, feeling unloved and unwanted.

The new life is one of imitation: **Imitating Jesus**.

## Heads

Teaching/[[preaching]]

Don’t be infants in our thinking.

## Hearts

The things Jesus loves, we start to love. The things he hates, we start to hate.

Rejoice over the things that heaven rejoices over.

We want [[church]] to affect our emotions.

It’s not just about filling notebooks (or zettlekastens!)

## Hands

Becoming a christian affects what we do.

# We as a church want to help people:

To leave things behind, to grow and to press in to the new.
