In his book about [[Living the Jesus way]], American pastor [[Eugene Peterson]] defines a local congregation as being:

- Personal
- Definitionally local
- Where people are taught to live for Jesus
- Where people have an opportunity to start following Jesus
- Where the community worships

He writes:

> A Christian congregation is a company of praying men and women who gather together, usually on Sundays, who then go into the world together as salt and light. Godâ€™s Holy Spirit calls and forms this people. God means to do something with us and He means to do it in community. We are in on what God is doing, and we are in on it together.
