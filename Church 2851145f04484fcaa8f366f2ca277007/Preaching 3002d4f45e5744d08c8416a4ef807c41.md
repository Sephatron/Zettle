# Preaching

in the NT this is interchangeable with [[Teaching]]. (see [[Community Group Bible Study 1]])

We could add today though: communicating the gospel to non-believers

Preaching is the gift of sharing the truths of Godâ€™s word with others.

Usually preaching happens in the context of [[church]].

I see there being (generally) 2 types of preaching:

### 1. Expository preaching

Teaching and expounding from the word of [[God]].

### 2. Thematic preaching

Teaching around a concept or theme.

## Sermons

As I turn sermons into notes, a shortcut for them is here: [[Sermon notes]]
