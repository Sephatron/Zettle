Healthy churches have a form of government.

Various churches do this in different ways.

[[The Community Church Honiton]] sees these roles as being central to the government of the church:

[[Pastor]] [[Elders]] [[Deacons]] [[Administrators]]

The church also requires a full representation of [[Ephesians 04 ministries]] to be spiritually healthy.
