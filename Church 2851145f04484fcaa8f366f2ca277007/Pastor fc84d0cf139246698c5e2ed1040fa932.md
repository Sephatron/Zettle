# Who leads the local church?

The word, “Pastor” means: Shepherd.

It comes from the Greek: ποιμήν (Poimen)

All Pastors are also serve as [[teacher]] ([[Scripture (WEB)/54 - 1 Timothy/1 Tim-03#v10]]). Not all teachers are Pastors though.

The role of Pastor is also considered one of the [[Ephesians 04 ministries]]
