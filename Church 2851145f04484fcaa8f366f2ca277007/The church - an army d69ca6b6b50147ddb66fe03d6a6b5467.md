# The church - an army

The danger with thinking about a [[church]] in one particular light is that we can think the church is just *that* thing.

# we are all soldiers

We’re called to play our part.

Isn’t [[Jesus]] just meak and mild?

[[Obsidian/Master/Scripture (WEB)/40 - Matthew/Matt-16]] verse 18: hell’s gates won’t stand against heaven’s advancing army.

Offensive rather than defensive language.

[[Obsidian/Master/Scripture (WEB)/60 - 1 Peter/1 Pet-05]] verse eight. It’s not like a war, it is a war.

Should we be surprised when the Christian life is hard? No. We’re in a fight.

The aim is to cause more “damage” than the enemy causes.

We don’t go looking for pain but we shouldn’t be surprised when it comes.

Being a Christian soldier doesn’t mean we should be aggressive and ruthless. Our struggle is not against flesh and blood.

[[Eldership]] in particular. Elders, are to have this grit and determination. The church should have right expectations for our leaders.

Sometimes we think of pastors as soft and gentle. Visiting the elderly and giggling with the children. Shepherd’s in the Bible cared, protected and then fought for their sheep.

Elders need to be prepared to fight. Who will wrestle for the church in prayer. Who will stand up for the gospel and hold ground when opposition comes.

Don’t be weak and passive.

We have weapons! [[Obsidian/Master/Scripture (WEB)/47 - 2 Corinthians/2 Cor-10]] verse 4.
